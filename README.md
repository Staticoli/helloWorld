# helloWorld
First repository being set up
I am an aspiring software developer who wishes to learn extensively in C#. I am happy to join the GitHub community and look forward to the many learning opportunities ahead. Please feel free to put in a request to re-edit my helloWorld repository with learning resources and helpful community blogs for coding.
